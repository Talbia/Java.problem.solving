/* This is a very simple Java program using command line terminal on Mac to compile and run a java program. 

1. At first, we will create a TextEdit file, format it to a plain text and save it with a '.java' extension
2. Write the java code
3. Open the terminal, view the folders (type ls), go to the required folder where you created the java file (type cd 'required folder') 
4. Type- javac 'Filename.java' (write whatever you named it), return
5. Type- java 'Filename'
6. It will print the lines you have written in your java program.
